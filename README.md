# TLegend
A scripting framework used to launch multi-pane terminator sessions with separate apps/processes running

## Features
* *Manage command files*: Store and manage your most used groups of commands
* *Create, test, save*: Create and test new command files while you build them. Save them as a new configuration and edit them as you like
* *Panic button*: Choose if you want to wait between commands execution, and stop the process if something is not going as planned


## Requirements
Software requirements:
* Python3.10
* GNOME Terminator

## Upgrades (Coming soon!)
* Using python3.10 will allow the contributors to rewrite a big chunk of code in a more readable way since keywords `match` and `case` are introduced

* The project should be clone and play. Make an executable release friendly to use
* *Configurations*: Specify where on your screen you want terminator to execute.
