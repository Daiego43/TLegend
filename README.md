# TLegend
A scripting framework used to launch multi-pane terminator sessions with separate apps/processes running


## Requirements
Software requirements:
* Python3.10
* GNOME Terminator

## Upgrades (Coming soon!)
* Using python3.10 will allow the contributors to rewrite a big chunk of code in a more readable way since keywords `match` and `case` are introduced

* The project should be clone and play. Make an executable release friendly to use
